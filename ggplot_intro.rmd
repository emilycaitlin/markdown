## Plan

We'll load libraries and learn ggplot2.

Here we write in Markdown.

# hastags mean headers 

two hashtags were used infront of ## Plan, but we can use them in the middle of a line, and they have no effect.

```{r}
# here we write R.

# hashtags mean comment
summary(cars)
```

# Load libraries
```{r}
# Loading my libraries
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
library(ggplot2) # install.packages('ggplot2')
```
